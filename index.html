      <h2>Briefly about myself</h2>
      <p>
        I'm only at the beginning of my path in IT, but I have a clear
        understanding of who I am, what I want, how I can reach my goals, and
        how I can continue to grow—both personally and professionally. I bring a
        broad and diverse background, including significant experience in
        business followed by six years in medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem-solving through analytical thinking and the ability to see the
        big picture come naturally to me. I have a systemic way of thinking that
        enables me to work effectively on large projects and conceptual
        challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        For six years, I worked as a physical therapist with children with
        cerebral palsy. This experience strengthened my soft skills, improved my
        teamwork abilities, and deepened my empathetic approach toward others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold two bachelor's degrees, which have helped me develop a strong
        understanding of how I learn best. This enables me to acquire new
        knowledge quickly—even from scratch. Most importantly, continuous
        learning, self-discovery, and personal development aren't just goals for
        me—they're a way of life.
