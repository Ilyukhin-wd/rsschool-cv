    ## Briefly about myself
    <p>
      I'm only at the beginning of my path in IT, but I have a clear
      understanding of who I am, what I want, how I can reach my goals, and how
      I can continue to grow—both personally and professionally. I bring a broad
      and diverse background, including significant experience in business
      followed by six years in medicine. Problem-solving through analytical
      thinking and the ability to see the big picture come naturally to me. I
      have a systemic way of thinking that enables me to work effectively on
      large projects and conceptual challenges. For six years, I worked as a
      physical therapist with children with cerebral palsy. This experience
      strengthened my soft skills, improved my teamwork abilities, and deepened
      my empathetic approach toward others. I hold two bachelor's degrees, which
      have helped me develop a strong understanding of how I learn best. This
      enables me to acquire new knowledge quickly—even from scratch. Most
      importantly, continuous learning, self-discovery, and personal development
      aren't just goals for me—they're a way of life.
